# Rutgers Vex U Programming Source Code 

## Setup your Environment (as of 2022)
1. Install the Integrated Development Environment
    + To start programming make sure you have Vex pros installed on your computer. To install pros first go to the <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/installation.html">website</a> to install the program. When you are on the website follow the instructions to install the ide on your respective OS.
        + **Note: When you have installed it, uploading on MacOS has seen some issues. So if your a mac user you have access to one of the lab computers.**
2. Setup Vex Pros with your IDE
    + When Vex PROS is installed, download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VSCode</a> for ease of use. Once VSCode is installed, make sure to setup the extension.
        + On Windows press Ctrl+Shift+X and type in PROS (should be the first one)
        + Install that extension and once that is done we can finally start programming
3. Once PROS is installed and VSCode is setup we can start programming 

## How to start coding
Now that we have our Integrated Development Environment ready, we can start programming ðŸ˜€!!!! To start programming, first we should start a new project. To start a new project go to VSCode and go to install a new plugin. In the extensions section, type in `Vex Pros` and when it loads it will be the first extension you need to install. Once that is installed you should see the Vex Pros logo <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22580992/123097191-e198b480-d3fd-11eb-903c-4c267f59fac1.png" width=10px height=50px/>. In that extension, click `create project` where it will allow you to create the project in the directory of your choosing. Once that is done, you can open the project and start coding.
